Add foldings to COBOL source files

## Configuration

By default, the foldings are enabled.

But you can disable the foldings for a project, with the following workspace configuration:

```
"cobolFolding.enabled": false // true, by default
```

## Dependency

The extension is dependent of the extension [Explicit Folding](https://github.com/zokugun/vscode-explicit-folding) which is doing all the folding.<br />
The current extension is only providing a set of rules to that extension.

## Mention

[@FALLAI-Denis](https://github.com/FALLAI-Denis) is the instigator for me to create this extension.<br />
So if the extension is useful to you, don't forget to also give him a thank :wink:

**Enjoy!**
